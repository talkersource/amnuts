~OLCommand :~RS read
~OLUsage   :~RS read [<room>] [<message number>]

This displays the message board of the given room, providing you have access
to that room (ie, it is not fixed to private). If no room is given it defaults
to your current room.
If you use the <message number> option, then you will read only that
specific message number for the room given, or the room you are in if no
room name is supplied.
