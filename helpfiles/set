Command : set
Usage   : set [<attribute> [<property>]]

Allows you to set certain attributes that will be shown when someone uses the
"ustat" command on you.  By omitting the <attribute> you will display the
current settings of your attributes, and also a description of what the
attributes mean.  Some attributes are a toggle between on and off, and others
require you entering a <property>.
