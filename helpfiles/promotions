             ~OL12 hours~RS login time before you are ELIGIBLE for a promotion to
             Honcho. A member of the law will nominate you, and then the law 
             will hold a ~OLvote~RS. If the law approves, then you will be promoted.
             (See below for promotion criteria)
~FG~OLHONCHO~RS     : When the need for a new Deputy arises, a Deputy or higher can 
             nominate you for a promotion. Again, all the law will vote, and
             if the law approves you will be promoted.  (See below for 
             promotion criteria)
~FG~OLDEPUTY~RS     : This is the first wiz level. Outstanding Deputies will be 
             nominated to Sheriff by the administration when the need for one
             arises. A vote will be held (Sheriffs and higher), and if you gain
             approval then you will be promoted.  (See below for promotion 
             criteria)
~FG~OLSHERIFF~RS    : This is the highest wiz level. All further promotions will be 
             decided by the administration.
~FG~OLMARSHALL~RS   : This is the first administration level.
~FG~OLMAYOR~RS      : Two words you should bear in mind when trying to get a promotion 
             for this level "no chance".  This is slightly administration and 
             programmer level.

~FB~OLCriteria for eligibility of promotions~RS

~FB~OL1)~RS Is a regular user and visits WOW often. This does not include logging 
    in and sitting idle. Having a ton of login hours is ~OLNOT~RS going to 
    guarantee a promotion.
~FB~OL2)~RS Has developed a good rapport with other users and staff.
~FB~OL3)~RS Has sound knowledge of all the commands available to him/her.
~FB~OL4)~RS Has shown interest in making ~FGWay Out West~RS a better place by recruiting new 
    users and by helping new users out.
~FB~OL5)~RS Will be willing to accept the responsibilities associated with the 
    promotion (especially with law levels), and understand that abuse of new 
    commands may result in disciplinary action by the administration.  You 
    are given the privlidge of a promotion, it is not your right.

~OLPlease do not hassle the law about promotions. ASKING for a promotion is 
~OLthe easiest way to NEVER get one.~RS

~FR~OLNOTE:~RS ~OLThe administration reserve the right to act outside these rules 
      ~OLin certain instances.~RS
