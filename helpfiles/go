~OLCommand :~RS go
~OLUsage   :~RS go [<room>]

This command moves you to another room, providing that room is adjoined and is
not set to private (unless you have been invited into that room).  If you omit
the room name you will be moved straight to the main room (ie, that room which
you start in).
