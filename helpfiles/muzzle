~OLCommand :~RS muzzle
~OLUsage   :~RS muzzle [<user>]

Muzzles a user which prevents them speaking, shouting, emoting and mailing
other people.  The muzzle levels are based upon the user level of whoever
muzzled the user.  If a user is muzzled by a Deputy for instance he can be
unmuzzled by any Sheriff or Marshall, if however he is muzzled by a Marshall
only another Marshall can unmuzzle him.
If you omit the user then you will be shown a list of the users currently
logged on that are muzzled.
