~OLCommand :~RS dump
~OLUsage   :~RS dump -u/-r <rank>/-c/-m/-s

This command allows you to dump talker information directly to files on the
talker's shell account.  If you use the -u option you will dump all the
users names.  If you use the '-r <rank name>' option then you will dump
only the users with that level.  If you use the -c option then you will
dump the last 16 commands used.  -m dumps the memory currently being used
by the talker, and -s dumps system information such as PID, netlink and IP
resolve status, and more.
