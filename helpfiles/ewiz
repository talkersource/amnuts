~OLCommand :~RS ewiz
~OLUsage   :~RS ewiz [<wiz level>] <text>

This command allows the Wiz to emote to various Wiz levels though they can
only specifically emote to levels equal or less that of their own. 
If no level is specified it defaults to WIZ which means all the Wiz levels
can hear it.
Example of emoting to all ARCH's: .ewiz arch grins.
