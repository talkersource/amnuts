This command allows you to delete messages from the board of the room you are
in.  You can delete specific single messages by supplying just a numer, or
from the first message to a given number.  You can also delete from a certain
message to another message, or you can delete all the board.  If a given
number to delete to is higher than the actual amount of message on the board,
then all the messages will be deleted.
