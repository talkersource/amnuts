~OL~FM*** Help for New Users ***

Welcome to the ~OL~FGObservatory!~RS If you are new to talkers or
just need some general help, this file will give some guidance in
how to use this talker. Nearly every command on this talker begins
with a period (.) .

To see a list of commands, type ~OL.help ~RS. To learn about each
command in your list, type ~OL.help <command name> ~RS.

If you would like a basic user account here, you must do the following:
first, change your ~OLdesc.~RS This is the description that appears
after your name when you type ~OL.who~RS . To do this, type
~OL.desc <message>~RS where <message> is anything you want up to a
certain length. Once you have done this, type ~OL.accreq <your email>
where <your email> is a valid email address where the administration
can contact you. After that, a member of the administration will
promote you when they log in, or if one of them is on, they will
promote you (to see a list of the administration and which of them
are currently on, type ~OL.wizlist~RS).

~OL~FRTo send mail:~RS To send mail to another user, you can use one
of two ways: to send a short message, type ~OL.smail <username>
<message>~RS . To use the editor (for when your mail message will
be a few lines), type ~OL.smail <username>~RS and hit return. This
will bring up the editor. Just follow the instructions.

All other commands can be found in the ~OL.help~RS listing. A list
of abbreviations can be found in the ~OL.news~RS. Good luck, have fun,
and don't hesitate to ask a wizard for help!
