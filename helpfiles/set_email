~OLCommand :~RS set email
~OLUsage   :~RS set email [<address>]

This setting takes your email address, and places it in your userfile for
use in smail to email autoforwarding (if system allows), and will show in
the .ustat command depending on if you have also used ".set hide" to hide
your email address from other users.
Using this command alone will clear your email setting.  Setting your
email will send you a short form letter to the set email address, that
will include a verification code to use with the .verify command.
Your email address MUST be verified with this code to be able to use the
forwarding if the talker allows.
This talker keeps your email address hidden by default.  See the helpfile
set_hide for more details.
