~OL        :~RS smail <user>@<service> [<text>]

Allows you to send mail to a user, or a remote service/talker if your talker
is currently connected to it.  If you omit the text then you will be put into
the line editor and allowed to enter you message that way.  This is
recommended if you have a lot you want to write.
