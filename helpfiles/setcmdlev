~OLCommand :~RS setcmdlev
~OLUsage   :~RS setcmdlev <command name> <level name>/norm

With this command you can alter the level of a command for the time that
the talker is active. (ie, if you reboot or shutdown the talker then the
command will revert back to its normal level).
If you give the option 'norm' then you will revert the command back to
its normal level.
You can only alter the levels of commands if you can use those commands in
the first place.
