               Compiling and running the Amnuts 2.2.0 talker
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

I had thought of dividing this version of NUTS up into separate source files
then compiling and linking them together using a makefile but in the end
I decided that it there was very little point as the code isn't that large
and once its compiled its unlikely to be done again unless you decide to
hack it about a bit or move to a different system.
This software was developed in parallel on HP-UX 10.01 using the ANSI compiler 
and Linux 1.2.13 using gcc 2.5.8 so there should be no probs with either of 
these. I have also compiled and run it on SCO 3.2, AIX 3.2 and DYNIX 4.1.3 and 
it seems to work fine though I have not done soak tests on these systems. 

To compile:

Linux & AIX    : cc amnuts211.c
IRIX & OSF     : ditto above?
HP-UX          : cc -Ae amnuts211.c  (you need the ANSI compiler)
SCO 3.2        : cc amnuts211.c -lsocket -lcrypt_i  
DYNIX 4        : cc amnuts211.c -lsocket -lnsl
Solaris        : cc -lsocket -lnsl amnuts211.c  (not guaranteed to work)
SunOS 4        : don't even bother unless you have gcc
               : gcc -lsocket -lnsl amnuts211.c   (IF you have gcc)
FreeBSD        : cc -lcrypt amnuts211.c
RedHat Linux 5 : gcc -lcrypt amnuts211.c

Netlinks:

If you wish to use the Netlink functions then you have to recompile using
the -DNETLINKS switch.  As defualt (using the above compilation strings)
Netlinks will not be active.  For example, compiling on Linux might look
like:  gcc -lcrypt -DNETLINKS amnuts211.c

Extras:

Some people have experienced extreme lagging with BSD systems when a user
logs on.  This is caused by the gethostbyaddr function.  If you find you
are having this problem then you should change the option in the config
file - you do not have to recompile with this version of the code.

If you are using MD5 encryption on your system, then instead of compiling
with the -lcrypt library you have to compile with -ldescrypt, as the
system Amnuts was programmed on used DES encryption routines.

Running:

The talker comes with a config file ready made (datafiles/config) which will
be a good starting point for you. There are some network addresses in there
but they are more of a guide as to how to set up talker links rather than
being genuine links themselves.  To start the talker just type "go" and it
will boot and automatically run itself in the background.  All its actions
are written to the syslog file.  To log in you then just telnet to port
7000 and log in as "test" with the password "test" as this is an account set up
with GOD status. The "go" script assumes the executable is called a.out.

I have included a 2nd config file called config2. This is so you can set up
another talker (by copying the files from this current one) and have them
link together. The only file that need to be different is the config file.
Move config2 into the 2nd datafiles directory as config and run the 2nd 
talker.
