   Introductory information for the Unix talker code Amnuts (version 2.0.0)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Welcome to the Amnuts talker code, version 2.0.0!  Or, if you have already used
Amnuts, then welcome back!  This is the latest version of Amnuts (as of May '98)
and many things have changed.  If you are already familiar with Amnuts then you
may want to skip down to the next section, else please keep reading.

What is Amnuts?  Well, you may have already seen the Amnuts website and read all
about what Amnuts is (it may even be where you got the code from), but for those
that haven't Amnuts is a talker server which is to be used on Unix systems (and
clones of Unix).  It has been written in C because of a few reasons, but mainly
because it is one of the best lanuages for the 'newbie' to get to grips with.
What is a talker server?  Well, basically, it's a program that can have people
from all over the world connect to it, talk, send and receive messages.  The
talker usually takes on a theme of some kind (my own is the wild west!) and is
then built up around that theme.  People connect to it via a telnet program.
Amnuts has been based on the NUTS code by Neil Robertson, although it has been
extensively modified!  As this is the second or third major release of Amnuts,
and because it's been modified further still from the original NUTS I have 
moved Neil's NUTS readme to the DOCs directory ('nuts_readme').
And that is Amnuts in a nutshell.  (ok, ok.. But I had to get ONE bad pun in
this readme somewhere!!)

There have been a lot of changes in this version of Amnuts, not all of which
are really visable to the end user.  Most of the code changes have been made
to make the code easier to update (such as add new levels), faster (a lot less
reading from files, now reading more from memory), and just optimizing the
code a little (like removing redundant procedures, or making existing ones
better).  But not only have there been code changes, but there have also been
some directory structure changes too (this is particularly important for those
who are upgrading from a previous version of Amnuts).
Please read the 'IMPORTANT' message to find out more about the directory
structure change, and the 'amnuts_changes' in the DOCs directory for more
information on what changes have been made since version 1.4.2 (the previous
release to this one).

Please always refer to Amnuts *as* Amnuts or amnuts (not AMNUTS, AmNUTS, or
anything else along those lines).  You might think this a bit petty, but there
are good reasons, I assure you!

I've put a fair amount of time into Amnuts, its documents and the website, so
I would appreciate it if you don't add a few small commands and then think
that gives you the right to rename the code.  This is very unfair and, I think,
pretty damn disrespectful of the amount of time that has been put into giving
you this code free, and also providing you with documents and the website.
Please see the COPYRIGHT information

The above was the only bitch part that I needed to do.  Other than that, I hope
that you enjoy the code, and if you have any questions or comments, ideas or
bug reports then please feel free to email me.  The address you can do that to
is shown below.  

Thanks for using Amnuts!  Enjoy!  (Damn! This was a long README! ;-)
