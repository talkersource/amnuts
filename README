   Introductory information for the Unix talker code Amnuts (version 2.2.0)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Welcome to the Amnuts talker code, version 2.2.0!  Or, if you have already used
Amnuts, then welcome back!  This is the latest version of Amnuts and many  
things have changed.  If you are already familiar with Amnuts then you may want
to skip down to the next section, else please keep reading.

What is Amnuts?  Well, you may have already seen the Amnuts website and read all
about what Amnuts is (it may even be where you got the code from), but for those
that haven't Amnuts is a talker server which is to be used on Unix systems (and
clones of Unix).  It has been written in C because of a few reasons, but mainly
because it is one of the best languages for the 'newbie' to get to grips with.
What is a talker server?  Well, basically, it's a program that can have people
from all over the world connect to it, talk, send and receive messages.  The
talker usually takes on a theme of some kind (my own is the wild west!) and is
then built up around that theme.  People connect to it via a telnet program.
Amnuts has been based on the NUTS code by Neil Robertson, although it has been
extensively modified!  As this is the second or third major release of Amnuts,
and because it's been modified further still from the original NUTS I have 
moved Neil's NUTS readme to the DOCs directory ('nuts_readme').
And that is Amnuts in a nutshell.  (ok, ok.. But I had to get ONE bad pun in
this readme somewhere!!)

Please read the 'IMPORTANT' file, and the 'amnuts_changes' in the DOCs
directory for more information on what changes have been made since
version 2.1.1 (the previous release to this one) because there have been a
LOT of them!

I've put a fair amount of time into Amnuts (well, actually, I've put shit
loads of time into it... Why beat around the bush, huh?), its documents and
the website, so I would appreciate it if you don't add a few small commands
and then think that gives you the right to rename the code.  This is very
unfair and, I think, pretty damn disrespectful of the amount of time that
has been put into giving you this code free, and also providing you with
documents and the website.  The same goes for if you nick bits of the code
to put into your own talker - a mention in the credits of where the code
came from would be nice!  Especially if it's a feature you don't find on
anything else other than Amnuts, or is obvious it came from Amnuts.  Please
see the COPYRIGHT information for more information.

The above was the only bitch part that I needed to do.  Other than that, I hope
that you enjoy the code, and if you have any questions or comments, ideas or
bug reports then please feel free to email me.  The address you can do that to
is shown below.  

Thanks for using Amnuts!  Enjoy!  (Damn! This was a long README! ;-)
