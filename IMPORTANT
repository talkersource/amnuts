        Information for the running of a talker based on Amnuts 2.2.0
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Ok, now I know how most of you just loathe reading these things, but as you may
have gathered by now, this one is important.  Please, no groaning!

I'm getting married on the 16th October, so this may very well be the last
version of Amnuts for a while.  There are a number of things I didn't get
done because time ran out, but ain't that always the way?   Don't forget
the Amnuts website though; http://www.talker.com/amnuts/

The most notable thing to put here is about the Netlinks function.  There
have been many requests for me to remove the Netlinks system, but I've also
had people ask me to keep it.  Obviously, a problem.  But I think I've
managed to work a way around it.  If you compile in the normal way (eg;
'gcc -lcrypt amnuts220.c') then the talker will run without any Netlink
functions.  The port that Netlinks normally uses will not be used in any
way.  The commands associated with Netlinks will not be in the command
listing... Nothing!  This should make the people happy who didn't want
Netlinks in the code.

If you WANT Netlinks then, when compiling, you have to compile with the switch
'-DNETLINKS'.  eg; 'gcc -lcrypt -DNETLINKS amnuts220.c'.  If you do this then
you will have the Netlink functions as normal.  The commands will the there,
the port will be used, and all that.  But note, the code AS DEFAULT will not
have the Netlink code active.

I'll say that again because there are always people who ask me about something
I've put in this document... The Netlink functions HAVE to be COMPILED IN by
YOU!
