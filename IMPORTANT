        Information for the running of a talker based on Amnuts 2.1.0
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Ok, now I know how most of you just loathe reading these things, but as you may
have gathered by now, this one is important.  Please, no groaning!  This is
information that will help you setup and run your talker - or rather it concerns
the setup of the directory structure.

Where as Amnuts 2.0.x stored its userfiles in directories named after the
user levels, 2.1.0 has gone back to storing all the userfiles in the same
directory.  This was chosen to make it easier for people to add/change
levels, and also to cut out quite a few extra function calls just to get a
level name.  However, only the .D files are stored in the USERFILES
directory.  The mail files, profiles, , macros, etc, are all stored in
their own directories.

If you are coming from using Amnuts 2.0.x then you will need to change your
directory structure into this new setup.  I have created a utility for you
to do this with.  The utility (called move20x_210.c) is located in the
utils directory.  It will NOT alter the user files themselves.  This I
have left up to the talker itself to do, and will load the old user files
version (2.0.1, 2.0.0 and 1.4.2) providing you have made no changes to
their setup.  If you have then you need to alter the function
load_oldversion_user in the amnuts210.c file.
If you are new to using Amnuts and this version is your first then the
directories are all set up for you so you don't have to do anything.

For further information on the directory structure, please see 'about_dirs', in
the DOCS directory.  Also, please read the other very useful information
while you're there.
