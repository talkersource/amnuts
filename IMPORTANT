        Information for the running of a talker based on Amnuts 2.2.x
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Ok, now I know how most of you just loathe reading these things, but as you may
have gathered by now, this one is important.  Please, no groaning!

I'm getting married on the 16th October, so this may very well be the last
version of Amnuts for a while.  There are a number of things I didn't get
done because time ran out, but ain't that always the way?   Don't forget
the Amnuts website though; http://www.talker.com/amnuts/
You may also want to check out another talker site, thanks to Squirt and
Arny, which is at http://talkers.talker.org/.  This website also has a
message board for Amnuts (as well as RaMTITS, Paris and others), and is a
good place to get coding help.  So check it out, and give it your support.

As of this version the userfiles have undergone a fundemental change of
format.  It will allow for a more robust way of reading the userfiles.  If
you are new to Amnuts then you can remove the functions
'load_user_details_old' and 'load_old_version' because you'll not require
them.  I have left them in though so that people who already use Amnuts
that want to upgrade to this version don't have to wipe their userfiles.
So why the change?  Well, there are a number of reasons, none of which I
want to waste space here going on about.  If you REALLY want to know then
email me and I'll tell ya.

If you WANT Netlinks then, when compiling, you have to compile with the switch
'-DNETLINKS'.  eg; 'gcc -lcrypt -DNETLINKS amnuts220.c'.  If you do this then
you will have the Netlink functions as normal.  The commands will the there,
the port will be used, and all that.  But note, the code AS DEFAULT will not
have the Netlink code active.

I'll say that again because there are always people who ask me about something
I've put in this document... The Netlink functions HAVE to be COMPILED IN by
YOU!

The *MOST* important thing to remember though is; RTFM!!  Read the
documents supplied with the distribution, look at the code, try something
out.. Only then if that fails should you go asking questions on boards and
such.  It also helps if you give an example of what you've tried too.
Like I said, I'm getting married, and I'm moving to the States.  So I'll
not have a computer for a while so I WILL NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS about
how to code, how to update Amnuts or anything like that.  Bug reports I'm
still up to receiving, but even then, don't expect a response.  I'm sure
you'll be nice and understand how I need to devote time to my REAL life
for a while...

Oh!  And if you want to send my fiancee and I a wedding present then feel
free ;)
