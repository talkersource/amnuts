        Information for the running of a talker based on Amnuts 2.1.1
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Ok, now I know how most of you just loathe reading these things, but as you may
have gathered by now, this one is important.  Please, no groaning!

The most notable thing to put here is about the Netlinks function.  There
have been many requests for me to remove the Netlinks system, but I've also
had people ask me to keep it.  Obviously, a problem.  But I think I've
managed to work a way around it.  If you compile in the normal way (eg;
'gcc -lcrypt amnuts211.c') then the talker will run without any Netlink
functions.  The port that Netlinks normally uses will not be used in any
way.  The commands associated with Netlinks will not be in the command
listing... Nothing!  This should make the people happy who didn't want
Netlinks in the code.
If you WANT Netlinks then, when compiling, you have to compile with the
switch '-DNETLINKS'.  eg; 'gcc -lcrypt -DNETLINKS amnuts211.c'.  If you do
this then you will have the Netlink functions as normal.  The commands
will the there, the port will be used, and all that.  But note, the code
AS DEFAULT will not have the Netlink code active.

I'll say that again because there are always people who ask me about
something I've put in this document... The Netlink functions HAVE to be
COMPILE IN by YOU!

The next important thing is about the talker hanging severely when someone
is trying to log on.  This usually happens on a BSD system, and it occurs
because of the gethostbyaddr() function.  I've attempted to fix this
little problem by adding a little bit of code (written by tref, updated for
Amnuts by me) that you, again, have to compile to activate.  If you find
you are having a problem with the talker just hanging for ages when
someone is logging in, then recompile your code with the '-DRESOLVEIP'
option.
