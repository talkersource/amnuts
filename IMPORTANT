        Information for the running of a talker based on Amnuts 2.0.1
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Ok, now I know how most of you just loathe reading these things, but as you may
have gathered by now, this one is important.  Please, no groaning!  This is
information that will help you setup and run your talker - or rather it concerns
the setup of the directory structure.

Amnuts 2.0.1 now stores the user files in a directory which is named after that
user's level.  If these directories do not exist then the user files won't be
loaded, saved, read or any of the very basic other things.

What you must do, if you change the level names, is to rename the directories
contained within 'userfiles' to the EXACT same name.  Eg, if you change the
level 'WIZ' to 'Wizardz' in the header file than you must also rename the
directory 'userfiles/WIZ' to 'userfiles/Wizardz'.  Please note that all the caps
must remain the same (seeing as Unix is case-sensitive).

The reason for this change (for those already familiar with previous version of
Amnuts) is that it makes it easier and quicker to count the amount of user of a
particular level, it's tidier (IMO) than keeping everything bunched up in the
one directory, and it also has to do with the way Amnuts now keeps track of
user names. (ie, the LEVEL_LISTs are now a thing of the past).

For futher information on the directory structure, please see 'about_dirs', in
the DOCS directory.  Also, please read the other very useful information
while you're there.
