       DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
    Directory information for the Unix talker code Amnuts (version 2.1.0)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The server has a fixed directory structure and expects certain files to be
in certain directories which I shall describe below...


datafiles
---------

This directory contains the config file which contains all the parameters
necessary to boot the server and also the room description and message
board files. These are in the form of <room name>.R and <room name>.B
respectively. Also the 2 ban files: sitebans and userbans are stored here
which store banned sites and banned users.

There is another directory in here, 'old_datafiles', just incase any of
you wanted the old rooms and config files.


helpfiles
---------

This contains all the help files. 'Nuff said really.


userfiles
---------

The root of userfiles contains the .D files - the user information.
There is also a sub-structure of directories which are as follows:

   friends  : List of friends (.F)
   historys : History of user events (.H)
   mail     : User's mail files (.M)
   macros   : Any macros the user has set (.MAC)
   profiles : Profiles is the user has made them (.P)
   rooms    : Stores the user's room information (.R) and rooms board
              information (.B)
   xgcoms   : Any commands the user has been restricted from using of given
              access to (.C)


mailspool
---------

This is where mail to other linked talkers is temporarily spooled ready
to be sent off or while it is being received.

Outgoing mail filenames are in the format of: OUT_<from>_<to>@<service to>

eg OUT_Fred_Neil@talker2

Incoming ones are: IN_<to>_<from>@<service_from>

eg IN_Neil_Fred@talker1


pictfiles
---------

Contains ASCII pictures that are used on the talker with the commands
"picture", "preview" and "ptell".  The pictures can contain colour codes
if you want.


miscfiles
---------

This contains any files that could not be classed into the other
directories.  I suppose they could all have been put into 'datafiles', but
I personally like to use that just for room data and talker
configuration... But maybe that's just me?


motds
-----

This contains the further directories:

	- motd1
	- motd2

Each of those contain the pre- and post-login motds.  You can have as many
as you like, providing you have AT LEAST ONE in there.  They are named
consequtivly, such as 'motd1', 'motd2', 'motd3', etc.  They MUST be called
this.


lastcmdlogs
-----------

Contains a dump of the last number of commands used on the talker before
it crashed (should it crash).  These dumps may help to track down bugs and
reasons why the talker has crashed.
