        Information on the changes between different version of Amnuts
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.0.0
-----

Now store all the user's names and level in a dynamically linked list on
start-up.  This allows quick scrolling through the users rather than reading a
file, and it also means that the user's files can be split up into different
directories (the directories having the same names as the talker levels).
Commands are also stored in a linked list now.

I kept a record of (almost) everything I changed for version 2.0.0, but as there
is a lot of text I'm not even going to bother to format it nicely just yet. If
you don't like it, then bite me ;)

changed count_users() to use dynamic directory reading instead or reading a list.
updated clean_files() to take a 'level' parameter.
removed add_level_list() and clean_level_list() as they're now redundant.
removed all instances (calls) to the above 2 procedures.
updated show_version()
added the procedures: find_user_directory(), in_user_directory(), add_user_level(), rem_user_level()
removed the procedures: in_userlist(), clean_userlist(), add_userlist()
changed all calls to open USERFILES to incorporate the level name
added command line variables for when booting the talker, also allowing automatic setup of the directories and quiet boot up.
added procedure: process_command_line(), setup_directory_structure()
added procedure: move_files(), change_user_directory()
added proper grammer (eg, '1 message' instead of '1 messages', or 'there is 1' rather than 'there are 1')
added an ! to the prompt to show if ignoring anything (though doesn't represent what)
changed toggle_colour() to display_colour
added the command 'memcount'
changed the "colour code display" character '%' to a '^' as this seemed to cause an obscure bug (though not harmful)
improved '.last' to also display the last x users to log on, also added new structure to header file for this and the procedures record_last_login() and record_last_logout()
added procedures count_lines, remove_top_bottom()
added the ability to toggle on/off room descriptions (.set rdesc)
changed procedure command_order() to parse_commands() and dynamically loaded memory for each command.  Stored the commands in a linked list (ordered).
changed user variable hwrap_com to hwrap_id and added hwrap_same and hwrap_func
reworked the help_commands() procedure so that: 1) it worked with the linked list and 2) fixed a little bug that might appear on some terminals that didn't handle the \r escape code correctly.
added the options 'rdesc' and 'command' to the set command.
added the int 'cmd_type' to the user structure and updated load_user_details and save_user_details procedures accordingly.
Done a little re-arranging to misc_ops to make things in a better order.
added the ability to change how the commands are listed - either the traditional method (ie, by level) or by function.
made wizlist work with the user structure.
added the ability to have a full swear ban, where it gives you a message saying you cannot swear, or a min swear ban where it will replace any of the swear words with a default string (see below).
fixed it in say() so that you can no longer swear through a netlink or clone even if the swear_ban is on.
added new swear_ban check to procedures say, shout, tell, emote, semote, pemote, echo, wizshout, wizemote, mutter, think_it, sing_it
added the procedures: censor_swear_words, replace_string
added a new #define's to the header file called 'swear_censor', 'OFF', 'MIN', and 'MAX'
added new procedure 'minmax_check'
changed 'ban_swearing' in the config file so that it reads either OFF, MIN or MAX (rather than YES or NO)
updated 'swban' to incorporate the new levels of banning and renamed it 'toggle_swearban'
purge procedure updated to use linked user directory list - reduced size of procedure
added a version check for users so that you no longer have to nuke any old user structures as they load up properly and same as the new format.
added procedure: load_oldversion_user
add 'version' to user structure
added 'talker_name' to the header file.
completely rearranged code and made it more tidy
changed sug_num to suggestion_count
added command 'cmdcount' to show command statistics, also added show_command_counts procedure
added procedure 'ordinal_text' to return the ordinal of an int.
added procedure 'reset_user' to put all user attributes to a default value - including name.
The above fixes a bug which could either be useful, or annoying - depending on how you looked at it.  The bug was as follows:
  If a user entered a wizzes name at the login prompt, messed up the password and then done a 'who' then they could see any invis users.
  Then, if that user logged in as a newbie the newbie character would possess the wizzes stats - login time, number, age, email, etc.  though NOT their level.
added the #defines LOGIN_NAME, LOGIN_PASSWD, LOGIN_CONFIRM, LOGIN_PROMPT, LOGIN_ATTEMPTS and updated attempts() and login() to use them
added user_page_pos and user_page_lev to user structure
updated exec_com to incriment the number of times a command has been used.
added crypt_salt to header file
added command 'rcountu' and procedure 'recount_users' to re-read all of the users and check if they are listed or not.
added 'date' variable to the user_dir_struct and user_struct and the command add_user_date_node
updated connect_user to show if user is ignoring anything when they logon
added 'recap' to the user structure and made changes through-out the code so that the recap name is show.
removed allow_caps_in_name and anything associated with it as that option has now been made redundant by .set recap - instead has been replaced with 'allow_recaps' as a config option.
added the command 'recaps' to toggle the allow_recap status
fix bug in editor that would show the users name even when they were invis
changed the command name 'plead' to 'sos'
added verbose_boot to the config file and count_users()
added recap to user structure, the set command, and used it throughout the code.
removed the 'new_banned' procedure and integrated it with 'site_banned'.  Removed a big bug out of 'site_banned' that would cause a file pointer to remaing floating around if a match had been found.
added the procedure 'pattern_match' to do recursive matching for a pattern in a string.
updated the mutter() procedure to use write_room_except (thanks Squirt for pointing that one out)
added the command 'setcmdlev' and the procedure 'set_command_level()' to go with it.
added the command 'grepu' to search for user's names using pattern matching
added 'default_shoot' to the header file.  Also added the command 'shoot' and 'reload', and the procedures 'shoot_user' and 'reload_gun'.  Updated the ustat to show fight stats.
changed lmail option 'admin' to 'wizzes' as many people use ADMIN as a level name
removed all LEVEL_LISTs from the header file, with exception of the RETIRE_LIST
added the option 'retired' to the viewlog command
tidied up code more - removing redundant calls, and unused variables.
updated all of the help files.
updated a few things in ban_site and ban_new procedures
made cosmetic changes to some commands
added the procedure 'check_directories' to make sure that the directory structure is correct
updated 'samesite' so that it now works with wildcards * and ?

sent out code for beta testing
