*** COPYRIGHT ***

If you alter the code could you please leave the credits in the code (.help 
credits) and also don't change the version so much that it doesn't say NUTS 
anymore when a user does the .version command. I find it annoying that after 
I've spent months of time working on this software someone comes along, changes
a few commands then pretends its all their own work. If you have a problem 
with any references to my name or the NUTS name being in your talker then 
don't use my software, its that simple, go write your own from scratch. 

This software is freeware, it is *NOT* public domain, I retain copyright, and 
since there is code in here that I have used in a commercial system I have 
written I will take legal action on anyone and their institution/employer who 
I find using it to their own commercial advantage by way of selling the code
of either this or a modified version. I have no problems with anyone running a 
pay-to-use talker using NUTS however.
	You are perfectly free to modify the code to suit your needs and 
distribute modified versions *BUT* if you do could you please leave my name,
the NUTS name and the code header in the code and also note the fact that the
code isn't 100% original.

*** Additional ***

Ok, now as Amnuts is still based on the NUTS system (though extensively
modified) I think it is only fair that any copyrights and so on still go
to Neil.  BUT, I *do* want recognition for the work I have done on this,
so you MUST leave Neils AND my credits in the code, and distribute these
documents with my additions if you pass on the code that you have
modified.
The same stuff as above (in Neil's section) also applies to my modified
version (ie, if you have any problems with references to Amnuts in your
code, not to be used commercially, etc)
I have emailed Neil and he is cool with me distributing this as "Amnuts",
rather than "NUTS", but please refer to this code as "Amnuts" and NOT
"AmNUTS".
