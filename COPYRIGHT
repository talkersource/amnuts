Copyright for Amnuts code
-------------------------

The Amnuts code and files contain within the distribution are supplied as 
freeware and not public domain.  I retain the copyright for all files included 
with exception of: the ASCII picture files and any unmodified documentation 
written by Neil Robertson.  I will take legal action against anyone/company who
is found selling the code for their own commercial advantage, though if anyone 
wishes to run a pay-to-use talker using the Amnuts code then they are welcome.
If you wish to distribute the original Amnuts code to anyone else this must be 
done with my express permission.
You are free to modify the Amnuts code anyway you wish to suit your own needs 
and distribute that.  You must not alter the .version so much that it does not 
refer to the code being based on Amnuts or NUTS or that the code isn't 100% 
original.  You must also leave the credits from Neil and myself in the code 
(viewed by '.help credits'), and also the header information from both of us at 
the top of the source code.
Amnuts should be written in such a way that there is a capital 'A' and the other
characters are lower case.  At no time should the 'nuts' part be written in all
upper case as it is no longer the NUTS distribution (this is on request of Neil
Robertson).
Although every care has been taken to produce a bug-free talker system, this
distribution is supplied as-is and I cannot be held responsible for damages
incurred through any use of the Amnuts code or any other associated files.
If you have any problems with this copyright notice then you should not use the
code at all.

Copyright for NUTS code
-----------------------

If you alter the code could you please leave the credits in the code (.help
credits) and also don't change the version so much that it doesn't say NUTS
anymore when a user does the .version command. I find it annoying that after 
I've spent months of time working on this software someone comes along, changes
a few commands then pretends its all their own work. If you have a problem 
with any references to my name or the NUTS name being in your talker then 
don't use my software, its that simple, go write your own from scratch. 
This software is freeware, it is *NOT* public domain, I retain copyright, and 
since there is code in here that I have used in a commercial system I have 
written I will take legal action on anyone and their institution/employer who 
I find using it to their own commercial advantage by way of selling the code
of either this or a modified version. I have no problems with anyone running a 
pay-to-use talker using NUTS however.
You are perfectly free to modify the code to suit your needs and distribute 
modified versions *BUT* if you do could you please leave my name, the NUTS
name and the code header in the code and also note the fact that the code
isn't 100% original.
